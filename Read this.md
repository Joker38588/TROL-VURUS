I made TROL SHOT in python, but a little bit of it was made by artificial intelligence, but it was a good TROL SHOT. It's hard to turn it off, but you can turn it off. If it doesn't turn off, it resets the computer after 10 in the meantime . 
You can take python code and make plugins, but I DON'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IF YOU DO THINGS LIKE USE BADLY AND DAMAGE THE COMPUTER!!!
